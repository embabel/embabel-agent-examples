## Meet the Cane Toad!

## Where Do Cane Toads Come From?
Cane toads come from warm places in Central and South America. They live in forests and near rivers. These toads have dry, bumpy skin and are quite big. They are part of nature there, where other animals eat them and help keep their numbers just right.

## Toxic Toads: What Makes Them Dangerous
Cane toads have special poison in their skin called bufotoxins. These poisons protect them from animals who want to eat them. If a predator tries, the poison can make it very sick or even stop its heart. Even baby toads and eggs carry this poison! This is why cane toads are so tricky for other animals and people. Always be careful and never touch a toad without an adult nearby.

## Friends and Foes: What Eats Cane Toads?
Some animals eat cane toads even though they are poisonous. Birds like crows peck at safe places. Snakes and crocodiles sometimes eat toads that are less toxic. But many animals get sick or die from the toad's poison. This poison, called bufotoxin, protects the toad by hurting a predator's heart and nerves. Some native Australian animals, like certain lizards and quolls, have learned to avoid the poison and can safely eat cane toads.
